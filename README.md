# General Project Instructions
## 7 Modules 
The seven modules are roughly summarized here. It can be helpful to read the module assignments early, so you know how to plan.

1. Getting Started
    1. Create your GitHub repo,
    1. Create and create and outline your Overleaf report
1. Background and Data Collection - initial data collection, extraction, ingestion, description.
    1. Report: Write up your problem statement clearly and concisely.
    1. Report: Write an introduction to your project.
    1. Report: Provide some background on prior work in this area. Cite all sources - all your references, sources, and resources.
    1. GitHub: Collect your data - gather, scrape, stream in, or otherwise define and extract your data
    1. Report: Describe your data  - like a data scientist - be specific
    1. Report: Cite your sources as you consult them.
    1. Report and GitHub: All external credit must be acknowledged both in GitHub (the README.md - and your report). This is critical. Academic integrity charges should be expected if sources are used improperly or without credit. Giving credit is a key part of analytics and science in general. Give credit - for your data sources, your background information, tools used, and especially any code or related projects consulted. If AI sources are consulted, give credit. This is your project and you must be the author - do not just copy and paste content directly. It's a challenging line, but key to your professional reputation. Use these projects to help you land the work you'd enjoy - show the companies you are respectful of intellectual property rights. 
1. Data Cleaning - start the exploration process and begin assessing your data - what culling and cleaning is needed before processing the useful parts (this is typically 70-80% of the work).
    1. This is mostly done on your machine and pushed/synced to GitHub.
    1. Use the report to explain your data size, attributes, range - what is numeric, what is categorical, what strategies did you use - how much was bad and what strategies so you need to clean it and get the useful parts. 
1. Present Exploratory Analysis - use your tools, explore your data (explain to your readers how you explored and what you needed to do to clean and prepare the data - include charts, tables, initial insights).
    1. Describe and present the work you did in scripts, workbooks, and/or notebooks.
    1. Include key summaries of data - and key code in your report. 
    1. They should be able to read your report without consulting GitHub, but you should link to GitHub to make it easy for readers to explore your code as well.
1. Employ Predictive Modeling - use your clean data to build a machine learning model (e.g. linear regression or others)
1. Present Results - interpret and present your results, predictions, insights, assessments, conclusions. Summarize your work in a concise, useful abstract at the beginning. Describe future work. 
1. Finalize Deliverables - deliverables should be essentially finished after Module 6.
    1. Module 7 is only minor (or no) revisions.
    1. Finalize your GitHub repo and Overleaf report.

# Module 1 Overview: Overleaf & LaTeX

In Module 1, I created an Overleaf account and began the process of understanding how to use LaTex, a reporting software.
* We were given a zip file that contained a template report and a template bibliography.
* I uploaded the zip file and began to modify the template report, renaming it "AndersonCapstoneProject." 
    * Modifying the report included naming my project, adding my name and personal information, and renaming the main outline points to align with my project.
    * I also wrote an introduction using prompts from our class assignment.
* Once I began writing the introduction, I found online articles from reputable websites to use as supporting references.
    * At this point, it became necessary to start modifying the template bibliography.
    * I found an online citation generator that used BibTeX style, so that I could copy the citation directly to my bibliography.
    * I added citations to the report.
* I also found my first image to use in my project report.
    * I found the image online and saved a .png copy to my Overleaf file.
    * I generated a citation for the image and added it to both the image description as well as the text that summarized the image.
